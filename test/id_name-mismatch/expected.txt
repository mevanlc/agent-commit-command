# Git Commit - Staged Only Mode

Commit exactly what's staged. **Ignore unstaged changes entirely** - don't mention them.

Branch: `main`
Identity: `Different Name <test@example.com>`

# Recent Commits
```
HASH Initial commit
```

**Warning:** Your email `test@example.com` has committed here as `Test User`, but you're about to commit as `Different Name`.

---

**STOP - IDENTITY CONFLICT GATE**

Do NOT proceed with the commit flow. Instead:
1. Relay the identity conflict report above to the user verbatim (they cannot see slash command output)
2. Ask for explicit acknowledgment before proceeding
3. **IGNORE everything below this line** until user confirms

If user confirms, THEN proceed with the commit flow (review diff, propose message, etc.)
If user does not confirm, cancel the commit.
# Nothing Staged - STOP

There are no staged changes. Inform the user:
- They need to stage changes first (`git add <files>`)
- Or use `/commit --all` to stage everything
- Or use `/commit --ask` for interactive help
