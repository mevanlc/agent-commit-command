# Git Commit - Staged Only Mode

Commit exactly what's staged. **Ignore unstaged changes entirely** - don't mention them.

Branch: `main`
Identity: `Mike Clark <mevanlc@gmail.com>`

# Recent Commits
```
HASH Standardize on labeled git status --porcelain output across all modes
HASH Only show identity reports when there's a conflict
HASH Add test infrastructure with per-case gen_repo.sh/gen_actual.sh structure
HASH Initial commit: commit-tool with hook support and test infrastructure
```

# Nothing Staged - STOP

There are no staged changes. Inform the user:
- They need to stage changes first (`git add <files>`)
- Or use `/commit --all` to stage everything
- Or use `/commit --ask` for interactive help
