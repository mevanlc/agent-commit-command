# Git Commit - Stage All Mode

Stage all outstanding changes, then commit.

Branch: `main`
Identity: `Test User <test@example.com>`

# Recent Commits
```
HASH Initial commit
```
# Staged Changes

Ran `git add -A` to stage all changes.

Output of `git status --porcelain`:
```
A  large_file.txt
```

> Staging backup saved to `/tmp/commit-tool-staged-backup-PID.patch`
> To abort: `git reset HEAD && git apply --cached /tmp/commit-tool-staged-backup-PID.patch`

# Diff

**Diff too large for inline display** (NNNNN characters)

The diff has been saved to: `/tmp/commit-tool-diff-PID.txt`

**Instructions for reviewing the diff:**
1. Use the Read tool to examine the diff file (you may need to read it in chunks using offset/limit if it's very large)
2. After you have fully reviewed the diff, delete the temp file
3. Then proceed with the commit review as normal# Instructions

Changes are already staged. Review and confirm:

1. Review the diff and generate a commit message (imperative summary, optional bullets for distinct changes)
2. Match the style of recent commits shown above
3. Present a **Commit Review** to the user in this exact format:

```
# Commit Review

## Paths
M  path/to/modified
A  path/to/added
D  path/to/deleted
R  {old/path -> new/path}

## Proposed Commit Message
<summary line>
[- bullet if needed]
[- bullet if needed]

Proceed? ([y]es / [n]o)
```

Wait for user confirmation before committing.
4. If confirmed: commit using HEREDOC format, then show resulting hash
5. If declined: run `git reset HEAD && git apply --cached /tmp/commit-tool-staged-backup-PID.patch` to restore previous staging

# Safety Checks

Stop and warn if changes include:
- Secrets (`.env`, credentials, API keys, certs)
- Large binaries that look accidental
- Files that seem unrelated to the apparent intent
