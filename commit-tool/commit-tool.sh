## Global Instructions

- You do not need to acknowledge that you are going to use the tool or the skill -- just use it
- You do not need to check for the presence of commit-tool.sh -- just call it -- report any after-the-fact failures
- Always use a descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes; do not use short, non-descriptive messages such as `sync` or `wip`, even if recent commit history contains examples of them
- Always commit non-interactively so no editor opens: pass the message via `git commit -F -` (heredoc); for an amend use `git commit --amend --file=-`. Never run a bare `git commit` / `git commit --amend`, which can launch `vim`/`$EDITOR` and stall the session
- If the flow is interrupted after the user has already approved, finish the exact approved commit directly with `git commit -F -` instead of restarting the review
- After committing, confirm it landed with `git status --short` (in `--staged` mode, unstaged changes may legitimately remain)

# Invalid Invocation - Missing Mode

The user invoked `/commit` without a required mode. Please inform them:

EOF
  emit_global_instructions
  cat <<'EOF'
**Usage:** `/commit <mode> [additional instructions]`

**Modes:**
- `--staged` - Commit exactly what's staged (ignores unstaged changes)
- `--staged-yes` - Commit exactly what's staged without waiting at the commit gate
- `--all` - Stage all modifications, then commit
- `--all-yes` - Stage all modifications and commit without waiting at the commit gate
- `--ask` - Interactively decide what to stage

Append `-push` to any mode to push the branch after the commit lands.

**Examples:**
```
/commit --staged
/commit --staged-yes
/commit --all fix the auth routes
/commit --all-yes update the documentation
/commit --ask
/commit --all-yes-push
/commit --ask-push
```

- The user explicitly selected `--staged-yes` or `--all-yes`, so the `y/n` commit gate is preanswered `y`
- Still present the Commit Review, then commit immediately without waiting for the user to reply
- Be slightly more wary of unusual files and similar concerns because the user will not have an opportunity to decline the commit
- If you find such a concern, drop out of preconfirmed mode and resolve it interactively with the user. Once dropped, do not re-enter preconfirmed mode; use the ordinary `y/n` commit gate before committing
- If a pre-commit hook rejects the commit for a mechanical, low-risk issue, you may fix it and retry while preconfirmed mode remains engaged
- For a more substantial pre-commit hook issue, drop out of preconfirmed mode and involve the user interactively

- Pushing also publishes any earlier unpushed commits on this branch; if there are several, say so
- If the branch has no upstream, stop and ask the user before creating one with `@GIT@ push -u <remote> <branch>`; never guess when more than one remote exists
- If HEAD is detached, do not push -- report that instead
- If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward, protected branch, remote hook), stop and report what @GIT@ said; never force-push, reset, rebase, or amend to get around it
- Account for the push in the final report, using the outcome lines in the Final Report section

# IMPORTANT: each compose_diff_* helper ends its block with a blank line, but
# `$(...)` strips trailing newlines on capture. Every call site must restore the
# separator with `+=$'\n\n'`; without it the next section's heading lands on the

# then never closes and swallows the rest of the output into the code block.

0. INVARIANT: ALWAYS EXAMINE THE EXTERNAL DIFF FILE IN FULL BEFORE COMMITTING. This is critical for security and correctness.
1. Use the Read tool to examine the diff file (you may need to read it in chunks using offset/limit if it's very large)
2. After you have fully reviewed the diff, you MUST delete the diff temp file for privacy and cleanliness.

1. **Summarize what's available to commit by status bucket** - relay the status above (they can't see slash command output):
   - Use concise, structured `Staged changes`, `Unstaged changes`, and `Untracked files` sections for each nonempty bucket
   - Summarize the content or purpose of related paths instead of merely repeating a long path list
   - First column: staged status (`M`=modified, `A`=added, `D`=deleted, `R`=renamed)
   - Second column: unstaged status
   - `??` = untracked file
EOF
  cat <<'EOF'
2. **Resolve mixed bucket state before staging**:
   - If any two or more of the staged, unstaged, and untracked buckets are nonempty, explicitly ask whether that split reflects intended separate commits or incidental staging state
   - Recommend one commit or a concrete split based on logical cohesion, and explain the recommendation briefly
   - Do not infer that split status alone means either one commit or multiple commits
3. **Audit untracked files when present**:
   - Inspect the applicable repository `.gitignore` rules and distinguish intentional source/docs from generated output, local state, secrets, or other files that normally should not be tracked
   - If the untracked files look intentional and the ignore rules look solid, reassure the user succinctly
   - If any untracked files likely belong in `.gitignore`, stop and resolve those paths and proposed ignore rules with the user before staging
4. **Ask the user** what should be included in this commit:
   - Suggest logical groupings if changes seem separable
   - If user gave additional instructions, use those as guidance
   - Offer options like "all of it", "just the staged", or specific files
